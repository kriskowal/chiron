Chiron
======

Chiron is a system of CommonJS modules that introduce:

 * a type system
 * base types
 * general-purpose functions
 * events
 * encoding, decoding
 * hashing
 * caching

Versions 0.2 and beyond are being developed here on Github.  The 0.1 
development train is in Subversion at Google Code [2].  

Node
----

    $ npm install chiron

Narwhal
-------

    $ tusk install chiron


Usage
=====

Chiron modules can be used both on the client and server side.  Chiron 
ships with a browser-based XHR module loader.  ``modules.js`` is a script, 
suitable for inclusion on with a ``<script>`` tag in a web page.  The 
script will instantiate a module system in the page.  In the script tag, 
put the identifier of your main module in the query string::

    <script src="path/to/modules.js?main"></script>

If your module library is in an alternate location, you can supply a 
library path on the query string as well::

    <script src="/modules.js?path=/js/&main"></script>

Tools for bundling and minimizing modules for production are presently 
being recreated for this version of Chiron.

``modules.js`` leaves no trace of itself in the DOM or in the global scope 
(it does not add any properties to the ``window`` object, and removes its 
own ``<script>`` tag from the DOM.  Thus, Chiron is very kind to its 
neighbors, and most modules are designed deffensively and non-aggressively.
